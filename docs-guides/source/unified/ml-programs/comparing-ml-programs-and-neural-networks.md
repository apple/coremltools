# Comparing ML Programs and Neural Networks

As ML models evolve in sophistication and complexity, their [representations](#model-representations) are also evolving to describe how they work. _ML programs_ are models that are represented as operations in code. The ML program model type is the foundation for future Core ML improvements.
