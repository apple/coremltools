# Getting Started

Core ML Tools can convert trained models from other frameworks into an in-memory representation of the Core ML model. This example demonstrates how to convert an [image classifier model](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/createml/creating_an_image_classifier_model "Creating an Image Classifier Model") trained using [TensorFlow's Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras "Module: tf.keras") to the Core ML format.
