# New Features

The following sections describe new features and improvements in the most recent versions of Core ML Tools.

## New in Core ML Tools 7

The [coremltools 7](https://github.com/apple/coremltools) package now includes more APIs for optimizing the models to use less storage space, reduce power consumption, and reduce latency during inference. Key optimization techniques include pruning, quantization, and palettization. 

You can either directly compress a Core ML model, or compress a model in the source framework during training and then convert. While the former is quicker and can happen without needing data, the latter can preserve accuracy better by fine-tuning with data. For details, see [Optimizing Models](optimizing-models).

For a full list of changes, see [Release Notes](#release-notes). For installation instructions, see [Installing Core ML Tools](installing-coremltools).


## Previous Versions

The [coremltools 6](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/releases/tag/6.3) package offers the following features to optimize the model conversion process:

- Model compression utilities; see [Compressing Neural Network Weights](quantization-neural-network).
- Float 16 input/output types including image. See [Image Input and Output](image-inputs).

For a full list of changes from `coremltools` 5.2, see [Release Notes](#release-notes).

## Migration Workflow

If you used `coremltools` 3 for neural network model conversion from TensorFlow or ONNX/PyTorch to Core ML, update your workflow as follows when you upgrade to `coremltools` 4 and newer:

| Conversion from | coremltools 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | coremltools 4 and newer                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TensorFlow      | Install [coremltools 3.4](https://pypi.org/project/coremltools/3.4/) and [tfcoreml 1.1](https://pypi.org/project/tfcoreml/1.1/) and use the `tfcoreml.convert` API.                                                                                                     | Use the new `coremltools.convert` API. See [Unified Conversion API](unified-conversion-api). |
| PyTorch         | First export the PyTorch model to the [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) format and then install [coremltools 3.4](https://pypi.org/project/coremltools/3.4/) and [onnx-coreml 1.3](https://pypi.org/project/onnx-coreml/1.3/) and use the `onnx_coreml.convert` API. | Use the new `coremltools.convert` API. See [Unified Conversion API](unified-conversion-api). |

### Convert from TensorFlow

With `coremltools` 4 and newer versions, you do not need to install the [tfcoreml](https://github.com/tf-coreml/tf-coreml) package to convert TensorFlow models. The TensorFlow converter is fully integrated in coremltools and available in the [Unified Conversion API](unified-conversion-api).

```{admonition} For older deployment targets

To deploy the Core ML model to a target that is iOS 12, macOS 10.13, watchOS 5, tvOS 12, or an older version, use [coremltools 3 and tfcoreml 1](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/blob/3.4/examples/NeuralNetworkGuide.md#tensorflow-conversion).
```

### Convert from PyTorch

You can directly convert from PyTorch using the newest version of coremltools, which includes a PyTorch converter available through the [Unified Conversion API](unified-conversion-api). You no longer need to use the two-step process for converting PyTorch models using the [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) format. 

```{admonition} For older deployment targets

To deploy the Core ML model to a target that is iOS 12, macOS 10.13, watchOS 5, tvOS 12, or an older version, use [coremltools 3 and onnx-coreml 1](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/blob/3.4/examples/NeuralNetworkGuide.md#onnx-converter)
```

### Deprecated Methods and Support

In coremltools 4 and newer, the the following class and methods available in previous versions are deprecated:

- `convert_neural_network_weights_to_fp16()`, `convert_neural_network_spec_weights_to_fp16()`, and `quantize_spec_weights()`. Use the `quantize_weights()` method instead. For instructions, see [Quantization](quantization-overview).
- The NeuralNetworkShaper class. 
- `get_allowed_shape_ranges()`.
- `can_allow_multiple_input_shapes()`.
- `visualize_spec()` method of the MLModel class. You can use the [netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) open source viewer to visualize Core ML models.
- `get_custom_layer_names()`, `replace_custom_layer_name()`, and  `has_custom_layer()`: These were moved to internal methods.
- Caffe converter
- Keras.io and ONNX converters will be deprecated in coremltools 6. Users are recommended to transition to the TensorFlow/PyTorch conversion using the [Unified Conversion API](unified-conversion-api). 

Support for Python 2 has been deprecated since [coremltools 4.1](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/releases/tag/4.1). The current version of coremltools includes wheels for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8.
