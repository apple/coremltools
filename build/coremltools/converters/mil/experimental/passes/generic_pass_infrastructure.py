# IMPORTANT: List of Asssumptions we are making about the problem
# 1) The user defined pattern has exactly one root variable, and one final output operation. As such, we will be searching for a singlular
#    root variable in the larger program, and using that root variable as a starting point for our pattern matching.
#    And, we will only match one of the final operations for the larger program.
# 2) The root variable in the larger program, where we start off the pattern matching, must have the same number of child ops as the
#    root variable in the user defined program
# 3) The outputs of an operation are stored in identical, predictable order. The child operations of an operation are stored in a random order.



class Pattern:

    """This class will have references to all the ops that we have captured in the main, larger program.
        Each captured op will be an attribute of this class. The attribute name will be the same name
        that the user defined in their pattern. So, if the user defines a pattern add(name = 'add_1') -> sub(name = 'sub_1),
        the pattern object will have the fields pattern.add_1, pattern.sub_1, which are references to the corresponding operations
        in the larger program.


        Minimum Attributes:
        root_var: which is the root variable of the first operation of the captured pattern (and corresponds to the user defined patternâ€™s root variable)
        final_op: the operation in the larger machine learning model that corresponds to the last operation in the user defined pattern.
        block: the block in the larger machine learning model where the pattern was found
        op_set: a set of all the operations captured from the larger machine learning model
        attribute_set: used for enforcing naming (ie, so the user doesn't overwrite any of the variables mentioned above)

        Setters
        set_root_var(root_var): sets the root_var attribute of the Pattern with the given root_var
        set_block(block): sets the block attribute of the Pattern with the given block
        set_final_op(op_name, final_op): adds the operation in question to the pattern and also sets it as the final_op

        Other Methods
        add_attribute(attribute_name, attribute): Adds an attribute to the pattern object. Can be useful for the user.
                                                  Verifies name using the attribute set mentioned above
        add_op(op_name, op): Adds an operation to the pattern, as an attribute which can be accessed and as part of the op_set
        op_list(): convers the op_set to a list and returns it to make it easier for the user
