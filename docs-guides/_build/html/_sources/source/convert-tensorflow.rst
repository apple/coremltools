Converting from TensorFlow
==========================

Starting with Core ML Tools 4.0, you can convert neural network models
from `TensorFlow
1 <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf>`__ and
`TensorFlow 2 <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs>`__ to `Core
ML <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml>`__ using the
`Unified Converter API <doc:unified-conversion-api>`__.
