class remove_redundant_ops(AbstractGraphPass):
    """
    If there are multiple ops with "identical" inputs, then they are redundant and all but one of them can be removed.
    This pass checks and removes such ops.

    Since all inputs to ops in MIL are named, two ops with same ``op_types`` can be compared by comparing their
    correspondingly named inputs. Inputs are treated as identical if one of the following is true:

    - The input is a constant var, in which case its value should have the same dtype and numerical value.
    - The input is a non constant var, in which case it should be the same var object.

    This pass iterates over the ops, takes its first output var, and then builds a candidate op list from the child
    ops of this var.
    This candidate ops list contains ops of the same ``op_type``, arranged in topological order.
    From each of these candidate ops in the list, the second, third, and subsequent ops are pairwise compared with the first op,
    and if identical to it, they are removed. For example:

    .. code-block::

        Input:
            %0 = op0(...)
            %1 = op1(...)
            %2 = const(val=4.5)
            %3 = const(val=4.5)
            %4 = op2(%1, %0, %2)
            %5 = op3(%1, %0, %3)

        Output:
            %0 = op0(...)
            %1 = op1(...)
            %2 = const(val=4.5)
            %3 = const(val=4.5) # this will get removed later by dead code elimination pass
            %4 = op2(%1, %0, %2)

    In the example above, ``op3`` is removed and all uses of ``%5`` is replaced by ``%4``.
