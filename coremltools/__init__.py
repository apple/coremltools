Core ML is an Apple framework which allows developers to simply and easily integrate machine
learning (ML) models into apps running on Apple devices (including iOS, watchOS, macOS, and 
tvOS). Core ML introduces a public file format (.mlmodel) for a broad set of ML methods 
including deep neural networks (both convolutional and recurrent), tree ensembles with boosting,
and generalized linear models. Models in this format can be directly integrated into apps
through Xcode.

Core MLTools in a python package for creating, examining, and testing models in the .mlmodel
format. In particular, it can be used to:

* Convert existing models to .mlmodel format from popular machine learning tools including:
     Keras, Caffe, scikit-learn, libsvm, and XGBoost.
* Express models in .mlmodel format through a simple API.
* Make predictions with an .mlmodel (on select platforms for testing purposes).
