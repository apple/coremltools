# Save ML Programs as Model Packages

The ML program type uses the [Core ML model package](doc:new-in-coremltools#save-a-core-ml-model-package) container format that separates the model into components and offers more flexible metadata editing. Since an ML program decouples the weights from the program architecture, it cannot be saved as an `.mlmodel` file.
