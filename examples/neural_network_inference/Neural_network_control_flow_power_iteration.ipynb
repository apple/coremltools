    "In CoreML Neural Network Specification version 4 (which is available from iOS 13 and MacOS 10.15), several \"control-flow\" layers have been added. CoreML spec is described in the protobuf format and for a list of all supported layer types and documentation, see [here](https://github.com/apple/coremltools/blob/master/mlmodel/format/NeuralNetwork.proto).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a neural network that uses a few of the new control flow layers. We will write a simple python program to compute the largest eigenvalue of a given matrix and then show how a neural network can be built to replicate that program in an mlmodel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose the [power iteration method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration). It is a simple iterative algorithm. Given a square matrix, $A$ of dimensions $n\\times n$, it computes the largest eigenvalue (by magnitude) and the corresponding eigenvector (the algorithm can be adapted to compute all the eigenvalues, however we do not implement that here). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the algorithm works. Pick a normalized random vector to start with, $x$, of dimension $n$. Repetitively, multiply it by the matrix and normalize it, i.e., $x\\leftarrow Ax$ and $x\\leftarrow \\frac{x}{\\left \\| x \\right \\|}$. Gradually the vector converges to the largest eigenvector. Simple as that! \n",
    "There are a few conditions that the matrix should satisfy for this to happen, but let us not worry about it for this example. \n",
    "For now we will assume that the matrix is real and symmetric, this guarantees the eigenvalues to be real. \n",
    "After we have the normalized eigenvector, the corresponding eigenvalue can be computed by the formula $x^TAx$\n",
