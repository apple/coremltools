    """
    Create a feature vectorizer from input features. This returns a 2-tuple
    ``(spec, num_dimension)`` for a feature vectorizer that puts everything into a
    single array with a length equal to the total size of all the input features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_features: [list of 2-tuples]
        Name(s) of the input features, given as a list of ``('name', datatype)``
        tuples.  The datatypes entry is one of the data types defined in the
        ``datatypes`` module.  Allowed ``datatypes`` are ``datatype.Int64``,
        ``datatype.Double``, ``datatypes.Dictionary``, and ``datatype.Array``.

        If the feature is a dictionary type, then the dictionary must have integer
        keys, and the number of dimensions to expand it into must be provided by
        ``known_size_map``.

        Feature indices in the final array are counted sequentially from the
        from 0 through the total number of features.


    output_feature_name: str
        The name of the output feature.  The type is an Array
        List of the output features of the network.

    known_size_map:
        A dictionary mapping the feature name to the expanded size in the final
        array.  This is most useful for specifying the size of sparse vectors
        given as dictionaries of index to value.
