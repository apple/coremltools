[Core ML Tools](https://coremltools.readme.io/docs)
=======================

Use *coremltools* to convert machine learning models from third-party libraries to the Core ML format. The Python package contains the supporting tools for converting models from training libraries such as the following:

* [TensorFlow 1.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf)
* [TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [TensorFlow's Keras APIs](https://keras.io/)
* Non-neural network frameworks:
	* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
	* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
	* [LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)

With coremltools, you can do the following:

* Convert trained models to the Core ML format.
* Read, write, and optimize Core ML models.
* Verify conversion/creation (on macOS) by making predictions using Core ML.

After conversion, you can integrate the Core ML models with your app using Xcode.

## Version 5

The coremltools 5 package offers several performance improvements over previous versions, including the following new features: 

* [Core ML model package](https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/new-in-coremltools#save-a-core-ml-model-package): A new model container format that separates the model into components and offers more flexible metadata editing and better source control.
* [ML program](https://coremltools.readme.io/docs/ml-programs): A new model type that represents computation as programmatic instructions, offers more control over the precision of its intermediate tensors and better performance. 

To install coremltools, use the following command:

```shell
pip install coremltools
```


## Core ML

[Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) is an Apple framework to integrate machine learning models into your app. Core ML provides a unified representation for all models. Your app uses Core ML APIs and user data to make predictions, and to fine-tune models, all on the user’s device. Core ML optimizes on-device performance by leveraging the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine while minimizing its memory footprint and power consumption. Running a model strictly on the user’s device removes any need for a network connection, which helps keep the user’s data private and your app responsive.
