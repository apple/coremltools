========

Examples here give an overview of
a few of the compression techniques, results
and the process that you may use
for determining which methods to apply and in what order, to your specific model.

The numeric data on accuracy and runtime provided is specific to these models
and will vary based on the model type and other factors (OS versions, hardware etc).
