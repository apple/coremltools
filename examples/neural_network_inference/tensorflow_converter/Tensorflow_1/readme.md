## Convert TensorFlow 1 models to the Core ML model format

- **[deep_speech.ipynb](deep_speech.ipynb)**

An example to freeze and convert a popular [TensorFlow implementations of deep speech model](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).

- **[inception_v1_preprocessing_steps.ipynb](inception_v1_preprocessing_steps.ipynb)**

An example to generate a classifier model with image input types and the importance of properly setting the preprocessing parameters.

- **[inception_v3.ipynb](inception_v3.ipynb)**

An example to strip the `DecodeJpeg` op from the TensorFlow graph to prepare it for the conversion.

- **[linear_mnist_example.ipynb](linear_mnist_example.ipynb)**

An example to get a frozen graph from the checkpoint and graph description files generated by training in TensorFlow.

- **[ssd_example.ipynb](ssd_example.ipynb)**

An example to extract a portion of the TensorFlow graph that can be converted, from the overall graph that may have unsupported ops.

- **[style_transfer_example.ipynb](style_transfer_example.ipynb)**

An example to edit a Core ML model to get an image output type (by default the outputs are `MultiArrays`).

- **[custom_layer_examples.ipynb](custom_layer_examples.ipynb)**

A few examples to demonstrate the process of adding custom Core ML layers for unsupported TensorFlow ops.
