    # NN always implicitly cast return types to fp32. Detect any return

    # casting. This pass must be at the end. Example:
    #
    # Given:
    #
    #    main(%x: (2, 3, fp32)) {
    #      block0() {
    #        %shape_0: (2,i32)* = const(val=[4, 7])

    #
    # The same program.

    # Alert messages about %shape_0 being implicitly cast from i32 to fp32.
    #
    # Comment: This pass should do more proper casting as backend supports more types.
