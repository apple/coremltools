# A TensorArray is essentially a runtime vector<Tensor> with
#
#  - an optional requirement "infer_shape" (True by default) that all Tensors
#    stored within the vector have the same size/shape (inferred by the
#    first element stored into the tensor)
#  - an optional "element_shape" which requires all elements to have this
#    exact shape.
#  - an optional "clear_after_read" (True by default) where read of an index
#    is destructive. (It doesn't *really* destroy, but just enables a particular
#    optimization where the tensor memory can be reused).
#  - An optional "dynamic_size" (False by default) where the vector is resized
#    automatically at runtime
#
# The way it works is rather odd. To enforce "control dependency" constraints,
# a single float (flow) variable is passed between operations that write/read
# the TensorArray. Additionally, a "Resource" variable is also passed along
# which contains the actual handle to the TensorArray.
#
# The TensorArray can therefore also be passed around as as argument to while
# loops.  Thus unlike a global "Variable", this really is better thought of as
# an additional type, a list[tensor].

# The way we transform it is to introduce a new type. list[tensor]
# The flow variable is the list[tensor] since that is consistently passed through
# every operation.
# The 'resource' edges then gets passed as void.
#
# We would like to delete the resource edges, but once too many graph passes are
# performed, this becomes very difficult (since tuple shapes have to be updated).
# The ideal is to perform the resource edge deletion *BEFORE* any additional
# graph transformations.
# The conversion of the flow variable to list[tensor] can be performed during
# type inference.
#
#
# After this op:
# All nodes which take a TensorArray resource input will have the resource input
# edge deleted.
#
# TensorArrayV3 op will only have 1 output, a flow variable.
